## Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) registration data to understand adoption trends, geographic growth, and market preferences in Washington State. The goal is to provide actionable insights for businesses, policymakers, and infrastructure planners.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Rapid Growth in EV Adoption**
- EV registrations have increased sharply in recent years, with the most significant growth seen in the last two model years.
- The upward trend suggests increasing consumer confidence and policy support for EVs.

### 2. **Regional Hotspots**
- Counties such as King, Pierce, and Snohomish lead in EV registrations, indicating higher market readiness and infrastructure needs.
- Some rural counties show emerging adoption, presenting new opportunities for expansion.

### 3. **Brand and Type Preferences**
- Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet dominate the registrations, with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) being the most common type.
- Plug-in Hybrid registrations are present but represent a smaller market share.

### 4. **Market Segmentation**
- Analysis by year, county, make, and type uncovers both saturated and underserved regions.
- Urban centers show high concentration, while suburban and rural areas are poised for future growth.

## Recommendations

1. **Infrastructure Investment**
   - Prioritize charging infrastructure in top counties and urban centers.
   - Expand outreach and pilot programs in rural and emerging markets.

2. **Targeted Marketing**
   - Focus marketing efforts on regions with accelerating adoption.
   - Leverage brand data to form strategic partnerships with leading EV manufacturers.

3. **Policy Support**

   - Collaborate with local governments for rapid EV infrastructure deployment.

4. **Product and Service Expansion**
   - Explore opportunities for new EV-related services (financing, maintenance, autonomous tech) in high-growth areas.
   - Monitor adoption trends to adapt future offerings to changing consumer preferences.

## So What? (Business Impact)
